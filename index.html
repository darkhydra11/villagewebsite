            <p>Wroxton is a picturesque village located just three miles west‑north‑west of Banbury. Set just off the A422, it is easily accessible for visitors and residents alike.</p>

<p>According to the 2021 census, the village has a population of 542. Wroxton is home to an attractive Church of England parish church and a distinctive thatched Roman Catholic church—one of only a few of its kind in England. The village also offers a sports field, a Village Hall, and a Church of England primary school situated on its western edge.</p>

<p>A local hotel and restaurant provide both meals and accommodation, adding to the village’s welcoming atmosphere. At the centre of Wroxton lies a charming village green, framed by stone cottages and a tranquil pond often visited by ducks and, occasionally, swans.</p>

<p>Wroxton Abbey, a Jacobean manor house, is another notable feature of the village. From 1963 to 2025 it was owned by Fairleigh Dickinson University, before becoming an independent educational institution operated by Wroxton College Educational Services (WCES). While the abbey itself is not open to the public, the grounds remain accessible for peaceful walks—though dogs are not permitted.</p>
