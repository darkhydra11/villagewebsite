            <p>Wroxton is a beautiful village situated only 3 miles to the west-north- west of Banbury. Situated just off the A422, the village is very easy to access</p>
            <p>As of the 2021 census, Wroxton has a population of 542.  It has a fine Church of England Parish Church, a Roman Catholic Church (one of the few thatched RC churches in England), a sports field and a Village Hall.  There is also a Church of England Primary School situated to the west of this village.</p>
            <p>There is also a hotel/resturant providing meals and accommodation. In the centre of the village there is a village green surrounded by stone cottages and a pond complete with ducks (and ocassionally swans!).</p>
            <p>There is also Wroxton Abbey, a Jacobean house which is now home to Fairleigh Dickinson University's UK-based campus. While members of the public are welcome to stroll around the beautiful grounds, the abbey is closed to visitors (there are <b>no dogs allowed</b>)</p>
