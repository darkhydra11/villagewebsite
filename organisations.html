            <h2>Table Tennis Club</h2>
            <p>In recent years the Banbury Coaching and Club Development Project has been working to help increase table tennis participation locally, including Shutford, with aim of growing the league. Shutford table tennis was formally established ~3 years ago initially with a handful of players just having a knock about, a thriving TT club has been gradually established. It began with 'adult learn to play' sessions with support from B&DTTA coaching scheme. Now the club consists of over 30 members of varying ages, abilities and diversities including juniors, 'just for fun' players, league teams and most importantly a good organising committee to share the workload. The blueprint adopted by Shutford could easily be applied to Wroxton and potentially a mutually beneficial relationship between the two villages could be established.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The number of Shutford league players has gradually increased and now we have 3 teams competing in the Banbury League. Availability at Shutford is now maxed out and therefore this season Shutford by king permission of Wroxton has been able to locate another 2 TT tables (+ ancillary equipment)  in Wroxton village hall for Monday matches. There are however plenty of spare Monday nights to also run TT sessions specifically for Wroxton villagers. This would be a great opportunity to create community-based table tennis in Wroxton - a chance for all ages to have a go, have some fun and enjoy the benefits of participation in a new sport.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Probably the best way forward for this project would be kick-off with some taster sessions to get people involved and gauge level of interest. These sessions could be supported by Shutford members and coaches. The tasters will need widespread promotion locally and ideally there needs to be a team of Wroxton based people to continually promote/drive this project both short term and longer- a positive characteristic of the recent Shutford scheme. </p>

            <h2>Bell Ringers</h2>
            <p>Curently, the Wroxton bell ringers currently practice most Mondays from 8 - 9 pm and ring on Sunday church where there is a service, as well as weddings and days of national celebration.</p>
            <p>We need more ringers, so if you are interested, come along to practice night, where you will made welcome and given some idea on what ringing is about and even given a go</p>
            <p>It is neither strenuous, nor dangerous, but a light physcial and mental exercise, suitable for all ages, very satisfying, and great fun.</p>
            <p>The more ringers we can call on, the less the commitment and you are free to participate as much or as little as you want</p>
            <p>For more information, telephone John Woodward on 01295 730543, or Trevor Pinfold on 01295 730524.</p>

        <h2>Poor's Land Charity</h2>
        <p>On 17th May 1805 (5 months before the Battle of Trafalgar) an Enclosure Award was set up to provide just over 18 acres of arable farmland to be the principal investment designed to generate income for what became known as Wroxton Poor’s Land Charity.  That same patch of land continues in the same vein today as it did nearly 220 years ago.</p>
        <p>The Charity’s primary source of income is the agreed rent received from the current incumbent tenant farmer working on the 18 acres of farmland.</p>
        <p>The Charity’s purpose is to relieve, either generally or individually, residents of Wroxton or Balscote, who are in conditions of need, hardship, or distress.</p>
        <p>The remit of assistance available is quite wide and varied; however, with only a couple of explicit exceptions the charity exists to offer support for those who might need it.  For example, in recent years the charity has made donations to individuals to help with the payment of high winter fuel bills; Wroxton and Balscote Village Halls were given a donation towards additional cost of heating expenses whilst open as a ‘Warm Hub’ centre, and a resident was offered some emergency financial relief because of their home being flooded.</p>
        <p>Do you feel you might qualify for some financial assistance now, or, more importantly, do you know of anybody who could do with a bit of help but cannot bring themselves to ask for fear of being judged on the issue?  If so, please make initial contact with the Charity’s Chairman</p>
