            <h2>Church Organ Restoration</h2>
            <p class="more-info">Click for more information</p>
            <p>As many of you know, the church is closed at present for safety. It has scaffolding up in order to remove the organ for restoration. The restoration will take approximately a year.</p>
            <p>In the interim, church services will be held in the village hall. There is a plan to buy a keyboard so that Keith Howard, our organist, can give us music and accompany the hymns!</p>
            <p>The scaffolding will be removed after remedial work is done to the floor of the Minstrels Gallery and plastering done on the wall behind...</p>
            <p>The J. Halmsaw & Sons organ is of considerable historical interest having been made by a local Birmingham organ builder; of particular note are the beautiful hammered lead pipes. Also, it is being placed in a Minstrels Gallery, where unusually the organist can be seen by the congregation/audience.</p>
            <p>The whole process is very slow—church wheels move slowly—and also costly!</p>
            <p>A very generous donation was given by Steven Trembath on the passing of his dear mother Andrée, who was so much a part of the village; her husband played the organ as did Steven. We have two further generous grants from the Oxford Historical Churches Trust and Church Care.</p>
            <p>R & S Young Organ Builders Ltd. are doing the restoration. Richard Young is a very experienced organ builder; his father was also an organ builder. He is passionate about his work; based in Rugby, he's much in demand and had to finish working on the Charlecote organ before he could start here on the Halmshaw organ in Wroxton.</p>
            <p>When it is restored, we can look forward to an organ recital!</p>
