                    <h2>Wroxton Remembrance Service cancelled</h2>
                    <p>It is with regret that, due to the ongoing organ restoration work and the upheaval the associated necessity of scaffolding erected in the church has created, this year's Remembrance Service cannot be held in our village church, and has therefore had to be canceled. Nevertheless, similar services are being held in Hornton, Horley, and Drayton churches at 10:50 am. Also, Balscote at 3pm. And at Alkerton Cenotaph on Monday 11th at 10:50am, which you are welcome to attend.</p>
