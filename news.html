                <h3>Thank You for Supporting All Saints Church Restoration</h3>
                <p>The Rector & PCC of All Saints Church would like to thank everyone for the donations received from the village fete and the Progressive Dinner. Particular thanks to Chris May, Sarah Colbert, the rest of the fete committee & stallholders, and Neil & Susan McLelland.</p>

<p>The money is going to be used for the repair & restoration of the church clock. We have one quote but are seeking others and have also asked the Oxford Diocese clock expert to inspect it and offer advice.</p>

<p>The organ restoration is well underway, and the fully refurbished organ is expected to be re-installed in church this Autumn after almost a year's work. Before that, the organ loft floor & stairs are being repaired, the wall painted, and there will be a new balustrade.</p>

<p>The other proposed works that we consulted the village about are in hand. We will keep everyone informed about progress on these and the clock repairs as we continue to raise funds.</p>
                <p><strong>Sylvia Wade, Secretary Wroxton PCC
