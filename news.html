                <h3>Wroxton Resident completes London Marathon!!</h3>
                <p>Lauren Wade (from Church Street) completed the London Marathon last Sunday (27th). Thank you to everyone for the good luck wishes, support & donations, they really were greatly appreciated. Her time was 5hrs 45mins but that included 25 mins of stops for blister treatment - and it was so hot for most of the day! </p>
