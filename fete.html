      <strong>Latest News:</strong> Thank you to everyone who helped out with and attended the 2025 Wroxton Village Fete! Lots of fun was had and it was nice to see the community come together once again. A special shoutout to David + Boris Dupont, who retained their title for "Dog that looks most like it's owner"!!
